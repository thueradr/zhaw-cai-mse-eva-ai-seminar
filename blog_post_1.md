# Personal intro
I am a part-time Data Science master’s student in my 4th semester at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). Alongside my studies, I work part-time as a System Engineer. My career in technology began with an apprenticeship as a Computer Scientist, followed by a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at ZHAW. These experiences have fueled my curiosity and drive to solve complex problems using cutting-edge technology. This blog focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of vision-language models and their applications to tackle real-world challenges.

# Motivation
Staying updated with the rapid advancements in AI can be overwhelming, but mastering how to read and write AI papers is a game-changer. The EVA AI seminar equips with practical skills to navigate AI literature effectively: understanding key points, decoding technical content, and distinguishing impactful papers from the rest. You’ll also learn to craft compelling, well-structured research papers that align with top-tier standards, empowering you to contribute meaningfully to the field. By honing these skills, you’ll stay informed, critically engaged, and prepared to make your mark in the evolving world of AI.

"Multimodal Generation of Diagnostic Text From Echocardiographic Data" is the topic of my VT2 project, where I’m working on a vision-language model for echocardiography images and diagnostic texts, based on the idea of CLIP. This topic is crucial for addressing the challenge of bridging visual and textual data in medical imaging. By building on CLIP's idea to learn shared embeddings for images and text, I aim to develop a system that generates accurate, context-aware diagnostic texts from echocardiographic data, enhancing the interpretation of echocardiography images. This research will not only advance multimodal AI in healthcare but also contribute to more efficient and precise clinical decision-making.
