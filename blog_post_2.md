# Paper style and structure evaluation

In this post, I will evaluate the paper “Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision” not for its groundbreaking technical contributions, but for the quality of the paper. My primary goal is to determine whether this is a well-written paper by examining its structure, style, and layout.

## What makes the paper a good paper?
<ul style="list-style-type: '✔ ';">
  <li>With 33'070 citations, the paper is already promising. Alec Radford, one of the main authors, shows with a total of 224'583 citations and an h-index of 38 both productivity and influence in the research area.</li>
  <li>The title is meaningful and shows the reader directly what it is about. The solution later became known by the easier-to-remember name CLIP which is mentioned in the paper.</li>
  <li>The abstract comes directly to the technical point.</li>
  <li>The paper is clearly structured and you find your way around. The paragraphs have a well chosen length and the sentences are not noticeably long.</li>
  <li>The author has worked with many pictures that are understandable and described in detail. They are also relevant and support the understanding what is written in the text. Many more graphics and tables are given in the attachment. The pseudo code also makes it easy to understand. The tables are also well described.</li>
  <li>The introduction describes the problem well, understandable and shows the importance of using raw data for a computer vision task. The advantages of nlp compared to supervised learning and its challenges are well demonstrated. In addition, the power of zero shot capability is shown well with the comparison to human performance. The approach is described in a separate chapter, which is not a bad thing as it is a little longer.</li>
  <li>No clerical errors were found, for example in citations or references.</li>
  <li>Although domain knowledge is required to understand the paper, definitions are well explained and different wordings for the same problem (e.g. training methods) from other papers are cleared up.</li>
  <li>Chain of thoughts and experiments are well described so that others do not make the same mistakes. The limitations are also addressed, which shows that the solution is not just being talked up.</li>
  <li>The reader can follow the paper well because the sentences are not unnecessarily complicated or long.</li>
  <li>The paper is from the year 2021 and therefore not old but also no longer the latest. At the time, however, it was a novelty and groundbreaking in the field of AI research.</li>
</ul>


## What makes the paper a bad paper?
<ul style="list-style-type: '- ';">
  <li>Maybe it's better to take the publication instead of the pre-print. However, the publication is much more compact and shorter, which is why the preprint should possibly be referred to for further information.</li>
  <li>The paper is a little long with 27 pages, but this has been corrected with a more compact version for publication.</li>
  <li>The approach at the beginning describes the problem once again. Leave this to for the introduction. The same applies for the motivation for the natural language processing dataset. Here it has some repetitive information.</li>
  <li>The experiments and chain of thoughts are somewhat long. What works effectively is not the focus.</li>
  <li>The effective performance may be mentioned in the abstract.</li>
  <li>The docoment is properly structured but the structure deviates slightly from the standard. Perhaps, it is better to provide information about related work in the introduction rather than at the end of the paper. There is no chapter for discussion, but the future studies are answered in the chapter on impacts and the conclusion briefly answers the research question. If you work with the standard structure, it helps those who only want to quickly skim the paper and read selected chapters.</li>
  <li>Related works are presented in the introduction in addition to the chapter at the end. In my opinion, talking about it once would be enough.</li>
  <li>Expressions such as "transfers non-trivially to most tasks" and "often competitive" are not quantitative measures and don't tell much to the reader. It would be better to state the facts directly, without trying to sugarcoat things.</li>
</ul>

## Conclusion

The paper is no longer the latest but still relevant to get a basic understanding of vision Language models. It has a significant contribution to AI research, marked by high citations. Its introduction effectively highlights the problem's importance, and the transparent presentation of methods and limitations supports replicability. The paper's well-chosen images, detailed pseudo-code, and clear writing style effectively enhance the reader's understanding of the topic and its complexities. However, the paper’s length, occasional repetition, and deviations from standard academic structure could hinder readability. Despite these minor issues, the paper remains groundbreaking and influential in advancing AI, particularly in computer vision and zero-shot learning.
