# CLIP paper review

In my last blog posts we already examined the functionality behind CLIP and evaluated the style of the paper “Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision” and its structure. In this blog post I’m going to review the paper using the IJCAI review template. The criteria are relevance, significance, originality, technical quality, clarity and quality of writing, scientific context, and an overall assessment of the paper.

## Relevance
The clip paper came up with a new training technic to utilize raw text data for vision tasks which scales easier due to the annotations that are no longer required. Another advantage is that it not only learns a representation but also connects it to language which enables zero-shot transferability. The results are comparable to SOTA models and are therefore of great interest to researchers.

###### score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (9/10 stars)

## Significance

The paper addresses an important problem by utilizing raw text data without the need of manual labeled annotations for computer vision tasks. In addition it allows to connect images and text in a joint embedding space which enables new applications like guiding generative models (like DALL·E or Stable Diffusion) by aligning image generation with textual prompts. The paper is now 4 years old and it's idea still plays a significant role in the field of computer vision and generative models.

###### score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (9/10 stars)

## Originality

 CLIP introduces an innovative training approach that scales effectively with image-text pairs, departing from traditional supervised learning paradigms. The concept is not entirely new but earlier attempts were hindered by the complexity of natural language. Advances in deep learning enable CLIP to achieve impressive generalization and perform a variety of tasks without requiring fine-tuning on task-specific datasets.

###### score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆☆☆ (7/10 stars)

## Technical Quality
The authors clearly explain the architecture, including the dual encoder setup for images and text, and the contrastive learning objective. They evaluate the model on a diverse set of vision benchmarks, including zero-shot tasks, demonstrating CLIP's robustness and generalization abilities. They also compare their model to human performance. Thanks to the public GitHub repository other researchers should be able to replicate the results. The strengths and weaknesses are well described in the paper.

###### score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (8/10 stars)

## Clarity and quality of writing
As already described in detail in blog 2, the blog has many strengths and minor weaknesses. Its introduction effectively highlights the problem's importance, and the transparent presentation of methods and limitations supports replicability. The paper's well-chosen images, detailed pseudo-code, and clear writing style effectively enhance the reader's understanding of the topic and its complexities. However, the paper’s length, occasional repetition, and deviations from standard academic structure could hinder readability. It is important to note that this paper is a pre-print and many improvements have been made to the publication.

###### score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆☆☆ (7/10 stars)

## Scholarship, i.e. scientific context
The paper has referenced other papers extensively, which indicates extensive research. Other works were not only mentioned, but also discussed and compared. The majority of sources used were up-to-date at the time of publication.
 
###### score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (9/10 stars)

## Overall Score

If we compare the paper with the real publication, we quickly realize that the authors had to make some improvements. The described method remains groundbreaking but the weaknesses in the writing style must first be corrected for publication.

###### score:<br /> - research result: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (8/10 stars) <br />- writing style: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆☆☆☆☆ (5/10 stars)

## Confidence on my assessment
I have already read a lot about vision language models and implemented CLIP for a project by myself.
